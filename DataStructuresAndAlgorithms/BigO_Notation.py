# Big O notation is used to measure how running time or space requirements for your program grows as input size grows
#  time = a*n + b -- > time = a*n ----> time = O (n)
# Big O notation refers to
# 1) Keep fastest growing term i.e  'a*n'
# 2) Drop constants i.e a   --> time = O (n) or O(n2)

# Measuring running time growth :time complexity
# Measuring running space growth : space complexity

# Complexity of binary search is k = log(n) --> k = O(log n)
