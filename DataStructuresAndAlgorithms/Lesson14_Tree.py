# Tree is a Non -Linear DS
# Tree represents relationship between Nodes
# Collection of entities called nodes
# Nodes are connected by edges
# Every node contain data or value
# every node may or may not have children

# root node is the orgin of the tree DS
# There will be only one root node

# Edge/Link is the connection between two nodes

#parent node/Parent which has child node

# Child Node/Child

# siblings node = nodes which belong to same parent

# Leaf node or external node or terminal node
# = A leaf does not have child node

# Internal node / Non-terminal node =
# Node which has at least one node is called Internal node
# root node is also a internal node

# Sequences of nodes and edges b/w 2 nodes is called path
