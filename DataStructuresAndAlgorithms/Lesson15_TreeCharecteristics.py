# Charectaristics of Tree

# Root Node: Top most node
# A tree can contain only one root node

# 2) In a Tree if we have N nodes then we will have N-1 edges/link

# 3) Every child will have only one parent but parent can have multiple child

# 4) Tree is a recursive data structure

# Degree of a Node: ( total number of children for a node)

# Degree of a tree ( highest degree of nodes in a tree)

# Level of tree( Top to bottom ) (starts at zero ) ( Level 0 , level 1, Level 2 , Level 3)

# Height of a node: ( longest path from leaf nodes to respective node ( count the edge)

# Height of a tree : ( Height of the root node)

# Depth of a node : ( Total number of edges from root node to particular node)

# Depth of a root node is always zero
# height of a leaf node is always zero

# Depth of a tree : ( Longest path from root node to leaf node )

# Application of tree DS
# Binary search tree used to search an element is present in a set or not
# heap tree is used to heap sort
