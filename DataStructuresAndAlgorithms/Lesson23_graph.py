# Graph
# Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges

# Graph is also a non linear data structure

# Every Tree is a graph
# but not all graphs are trees

# tree has only one path to reach any node from root node

# Graph has many paths to reach between any nodes
# In graphs there will not be any root nodes present

# study of graphs is called as graph theory

# G = ( V, E)
# G = Graph
# V = set of Vertices
# E = Set of Edges

# () : Ordered pair
# {} : Unordered pair

# Applications of Graph
# Google Maps and GPS ( shortest path)
# Facebook and linkedin ( Friends)
# e-commerce websites ( Recommendations)

# types of graphs
# Direction of edge: if a direction of edge is mentioned
# undirection of edge : if a direction of edge is not mentioned

# Undirected graph: A graph in which all the edges are bidirectional
# eg facebook friends request

# Directed Graph: A graph in which all the edges are unidirectional
# eg: Twitter follow

# weighted graph: A graph in which each edge is assigned with some weight/cost/value
# unweighted graph : A graph where there is no value or weight associated with the edge.

# cyclic graph :
# Acyclic graph :


# Path : Sequence of vertices in which each pair of successive node is
# connected by an edge.

# Simple path:
# A path is simple if all of its veritces are distinct

# closed path : A path is closed if the first and last node of that path is same

# cycle or simple cycle: cycle is path in which first and last node need to be same and also all the other nodes
# need to be distinct


# Connected graph : A graph is said to be connected if there is a path
# from any node to any other node

# strongly connected graph : same as connected graph but it is directed

# weakly connected graph


# Degree of a node = number of edges connected to it

# indegree of a node = number of edges coming to that node

# outdegree of a node = number of edges going outside from that node

# complete graph:
# if there is an edge between all the nodes
