# Graph traversal algorithm
# 1) DFS : Depth first search
#       - Consider starting node as current node and visit that node.
#       - visit the unvisited adjacent node of current node, make that node as a current node
#       - Follow step 2 until we reach dead end
#       - If unvisited nodes are present in the graph then back track
#       take recent visited node as current node repeat step 2
#

# stack algorithm used in DFS algorithm
# as DFS used LIFO model then we are using stack operations


# Adjacency list representation
# recursion approach





















# 2) BFS : Breadth first search
