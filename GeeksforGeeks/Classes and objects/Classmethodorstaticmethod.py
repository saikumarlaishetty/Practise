"""A class method takes cls as the first parameter while a static method needs no specific parameters.
A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method canâ€™t access or modify it.
In general, static methods know nothing about the class state. They are utility-type methods that take some parameters 
and work upon those parameters. On the other hand class methods must have class as a parameter.
We use @classmethod decorator in python to create a class method and we use @staticmethod decorator to create a static 
method in python.
"""

"""
When to use what?
We generally use class method to create factory methods. Factory methods return class objects 
( similar to a constructor ) for different use cases.
We generally use static methods to create utility functions.
