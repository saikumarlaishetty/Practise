# General Tree
# Each node have any number of child nodes

# Binary Tree
# Every node have at most 2 child

# Binary tree of 5 types
# 1) full binary Tree
# 2) complete binary tree
# 3) perfect binary tree
# 4) Balanced binary tree
# 5) Degenerate binary tree or pathological binary tree


# Full  binary tree
# Type of binary tree in which every node has 0 or 2 child nodes
#            or
# Type of binary tree in which every node other than leaf nodes has 2 children


# Complete binary tree
# All levels except last level completely filled
# Last level need to be completely filled or filled left to right.


# Perfect binary tree
# Type of binary tree in which all internal nodes contain 2 children
# and all leaf nodes are present is same level.


# Balanced Binary Tree
# diff = height of left sub tree - height of right sub tree
# the difference must be less than or equal to one.


# Degenerate binary tree or pathological binary tree
# Every parent node has only one child node
