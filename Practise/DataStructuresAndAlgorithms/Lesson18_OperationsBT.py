# Operations of binary search Tree
# Operations of BST
# 1)Searching of a value


# 2) Insertion of a value


# 3) Delete the operation on BST
  # a) if 0 child
  # b) if 1 child
  # c) if 2 child then largest value of left Subtree or
  # smallest value of the right subtree


# 4) Traversal operation
#  A) Pre -order traversal
#     a) Vist the root node
#     b) Traversing the left sub tree and finally
#     c) Traversing the right sub tree

    # B) In order traversal
    #   a) Traversing the left sub tree
    #   b) Vist the rot node and finally
    #   c) Traversing the right sub tree
# we get keys or numbers or values in ascending order

# C) Post order traversal
#    a) Traversing the left sub tree
#    b) Traversing the right sub tree and finally
#    c) Visit the root node


# D) Level order Traversal or breadth first traversal algorithm.
#   a) Traversing level wise from Level 0 or root , Level 1, Level 2 etc..


# How to find the Max or Minimum value in BST
#  Smallest node:
# Need to check in the left sub tree
# left <= root/node < right

# Largest node
# Need to check in the right sub tree
# left <= root/node < right


# Total number of nodes in binary search tree
# = no. of nodes LST + no. of nodes in RST + 1
