# Heap Data structure
# 1) Binary heap  : Complete binary tree which satisfies the heap property
    # a) Min heap/min binary heap :
                # Complete binary tree, where the key of every parent node is
                #less than or equal to child nodes key


    # Max heap/ max binary heap :
                # Complete binary tree, where the key of
                # every parent node is greater than or equal to child nodes key

    # A binary heap is one which is having min heap or max heap.

    # Where to use binary heap:
    # Binary heap is used for implementing priority queue
    # Use in heap sort alogorithm
    # To find kth largest or smallest element in list of numbers


    # Binary heap operations:
    #  1) Heapify : Its a process to rearrange the elements of the
    # heap in order to maintain the heap property

    # Make sure that every node of tree follows heap property
    # Used to binary heap from a complete binary tree

    # Heapify operations
    # 1) Insertion operation
    #  2) Deletion operation
    # 3) while creating a binary heap from given array

    # 2 type in heapify
    # 1) Heapify up = is a bottom up approach ( or up_heap or bubble_up or percolate  up or sift up or trickle up or swim up  or cascade up
    # 2) Heapify down = is a top down approach ( or down_heap or bubble_down or percolate down or sift down or extract min/ extrack max or sink down

    # Insertion operation on binary heap:
    # Inserting a new node to binary heap by maintaining its properties

    # Insertion
    # 1. Add the new node to first open spot available in the lower level
    # 2. Heapify the new node

    # two types of insertion i.e max heap and min heap

    # Deletion
    # Removing the node from binary heap by maintaining its properties

    # Deletion
    # 1. Swap the node you want to delete with the last node
    # 2. Delete the last node
    # 3. Heapify the last node which is now placed in the deleted node position

    # Extract min/max key:

    # get min/max key:

    # Binary heap 2nd method of insertion
    # 1. First create complete binary tree using given list of numbers
    # 2. Then start heapifying tree: start from last leaf node

    




# 2) Binomial Heap :
# 3) Fibnoaci Heap
