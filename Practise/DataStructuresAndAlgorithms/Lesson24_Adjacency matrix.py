# Graph representation

# 1) Adjacency matrix
# 2) Adjacency list

# 1) Adjacency matrix

# represents the connection between the nodes in matrix form

# how to create a matrix
# 1) Creakte kXk matrix
# 2) Row and column reprsents the nodes of the graph
# 3) if edge is present then store 1 otherwise store 0

# Adjacency matrix
# we are saving the memory of zeros in adjaceny matrix . hence
# wasting the money
# so we can use adjancey list to represent the graph


# 2) Adjaceny list
# we can write graph in list of lists
# we can write graph in list of dictinoaries
