# Linked list has two main benefits over an array
# 1)  You don't need to preallocate space
# 2) Insertion is easier

# Linked list traversal 0(n)
# Accessing element by value 0(n)


# Double linked list
# You will have link to both previous element as well as next element


# Implementation of linked list in python
